## Introduction
This project was conducted as part of a gym membership data analysis. The analysis focuses on understanding the distribution and trends of gym members across different locations, age groups, gender, and residency status. With a total of **34,356 members**, the project aims to provide insights that can help optimize gym operations, improve member engagement, and understand member demographics.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to analyze various aspects of the gym membership data, including:
- **Location-wise Distribution:** Identify where gym members are concentrated across different facilities.
- **Group Distribution:** Analyze gym membership by group, including Adults, Youth/Teen, Preschool, and Homeschool members.
- **Resident vs. Non-Resident Distribution:** Understand the membership ratio of residents and non-residents.
- **Gender Distribution:** Explore the male vs. female membership balance.
- **Membership Trends by Year:** Investigate how membership numbers have evolved over the years.

## Visualizations

The project includes visual representations of the data, created using **Power BI**, including:
- **Gym Members by Location:** A bar chart showing the number of members at various gym locations.
- **Gym Members by Group:** A bar chart comparing the number of members in different age groups (Adult, Youth/Teen, Preschool, and Homeschool).
- **Resident vs. Non-Resident Distribution:** A donut chart displaying the ratio of resident and non-resident gym members.
- **Male vs. Female Distribution:** A donut chart showing the gender distribution of gym members.
- **Gym Members by Year:** A line chart showing membership trends across different years.

## Steps

### Data Analysis & Visualization:
The datasets were analyzed using **Power BI** to generate insights. The visualizations include:
- Location-wise membership distribution
- Group-based membership distribution (Adults, Youth/Teen, Preschool, Homeschool)
- Gender distribution (Male/Female)
- Resident vs Non-Resident membership ratio
- Trends in gym membership over several years

## Results:
The analysis provided a detailed view of the gym's membership composition. Key findings include:
- **Magnolia Gymnasium** and **Sycamore Gymnasium** have the highest number of members.
- The **Adult group** dominates the gym membership across all locations.
- **Residents** make up a larger percentage of gym members than non-residents.
- **Male members** slightly outnumber **female members**.
- A notable spike in gym membership occurred in **2016**, suggesting a significant increase in gym participation during that year.

These insights can be used by gym management to make informed decisions about resource allocation, targeted marketing, and membership engagement strategies.

## Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data analysis and visualization.
